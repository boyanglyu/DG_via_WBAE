# Code for "Barycentric-alignment and reconstruction loss minimization for domain generalization"
We use the DomainBed package to conduct our experiments in DomainBed setting. 
The original DomainBed code can be found here: https://github.com/facebookresearch/DomainBed

We use the SWAD package to conduct our experiments in SWAD setting. 
The original SWAD code can be found here: https://github.com/khanrc/swad

Our WBAE algorithm is in algorithms.py file. 

Scripted for distributed training are added to the project with the name *_ddp.py
